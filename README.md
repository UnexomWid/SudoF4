# About

You know how some games hook `Alt+F4` on purpose to stop people from rage quitting?

Yeah, that's fucked. Most people use task manager anyway, so the hook is pointless.

`Alt+F4` is an explicit request - the user wants the program to close immediately.

To hook `Alt + F4` is to assume you understand what the user wants more than the user does.

Therefore, I present to you **SudoF4**.

# Yay!

No more shitty hooks. Just press `Win+F4` and the current window will be sent into the depths the void: completely and utterly.

Despite its name, SudoF4 only works on Windows.

Yeah the code ain't great, but it's not about that.

It's about the message. No one wants shitty `Alt+F4` hooks!
